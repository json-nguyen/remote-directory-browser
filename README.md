# Teleport Senior Fullstack Engineer

Welcome! This repository contains the interview challenge for
[L4 fullstack engineers](https://github.com/gravitational/careers/blob/main/levels/fullstack.pdf)
at [Teleport](https://goteleport.com).

We will use this project in order to evaluate your skill in the following areas:

- Taking existing high-level requirements and translating them to a functional
  application
- Writing production level code that does not depend on gigabytes of npm
  packages
- Communicating with the team when working on the challenge
- Handling feedback

We believe this technique is not only better but also more fun compared to
whiteboard/quiz interviews so common in the industry. It’s not without the
downsides - it could take longer than traditional interviews. That said, it's
our view that this type of challenge gives us a more accurate assessment of your
ability to work well on the types of projects we’re working on day-to-day here
at Teleport. [Some of the best teams use coding
challenges](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/). We
appreciate your time and are looking forward to hacking on this project
together.

## Summary

In this challenge, you will build an application that allows a user to browse
directory content on a remote server. Think Google Drive, Dropbox, or even
GitHub's file browser.

This repository serves as a starting point, feel free to customize it as you
please.

### Development Notes

The Go backend in this repository uses the [`embed`](https://pkg.go.dev/embed)
package to embed the React app inside the Go binary. Running `go build` in the
root will capture whatever is present in the `web/build` subdirectory.

To ensure you have an up to date copy of the web app in your binary, you should:

- `cd web`
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm build`
- `cd ..`
- `go build`

The Go app is hardcoded to listen on port 8080.

For a faster feedback loop and more developer friendly process, you can run
the webapp's dev server alongside the Go backend:

```
$ cd web
$ pnpm start
```

This will run the Vite dev server on port 3000. Make sure the Go backend is
running and that you're accessing port 3000 in your browser. If you mistakenly
access port 8080 in the browser you will see the version of the UI embedded in
the binary and not the one served by the dev server. The webapp is already
configured to proxy API requests to the Go backend on port 8080.

## Tools

In order to provide an experience similar to working on Teleport itself, we've
selected tools that align with our internal development environment.

- Version control and code review performed via GitHub
- The backend API is written in Go
- The frontend is a React app written in TypeScript

At Teleport, we use [styled components](https://styled-components.com) for
styling, but you are not required to use them for this challenge.

## Levels

There are 6 engineering levels at Teleport. This challenge is for _level 4_.

For fullstack engineers, levels 5 and 6 are only for internal promotions. Check
[Fullstack Engineering Levels](https://github.com/gravitational/careers/blob/main/levels/fullstack.pdf)
for more details.

## Requirements

Implement an application that allows a user to browse directory content on a
remote server.

This application should have the following functionality:

- A Go backend that serves the webapp and an API
- The UI, which should include client-side filtering and sorting capabilities
  and URL-based navigation.
- Strong authentication

Additionally, we are a security-focused company and place an extra emphasis on
security for senior engineering candidates. We will expect your solution to have
a strong security posture as it pertains to authentication, encryption, and
overall web security.

### API

This repository includes just enough starter code to serve up both the web app
and a sample API endpoint.

The starter code here only listens for plain-text HTTP. At Teleport, we avoid
plain-text connections and prefer to encrypt all data in transit. You will be
responsible for adding TLS.

Your API should serve file information for files under a specific directory.
You are welcome to hard-code a directory, default to the working directory,
or create some sort of configuration to indicate which directory to serve.
In the past, some candidates have opted for the app to serve information about
its own source code. Other candidates have committed a small directory structure
to their repo and used that. Either approach is fine, _so long as you are serving
information about real files that exist on disk_ (not fake data). If we create
a new file in the shared directory and refresh the browser page, we expect to
see the new file show up.

Your API only needs to return the contents of the requested directory and does
not need to recurse into subdirectories. The following is an example of an
acceptable API response:

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "type": "dir",
  "size": 0,
  "contents": [
    {
      "name": "README.md",
      "type": "file",
      "size": 12345
    },
    {
      "name": "images",
      "type": "dir",
      "size": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

When you add authentication (the requirements for which are outlined later in
this document), the API will also need to support session management (logging in
and out).

### UI

The UI should allow a user to view the contents of a single directory. Clicking
on a subdirectory should navigate to that directory and refresh the contents.
Unlike other commercial tools, _file preview is not required_. Clicking on a
file should not do anything.

The following features are required:

- [ ] Display the filename, type (file or directory), and human-readable size for files.
- [ ] Add support for filtering the directory contents based on filename.
      Filtering should be performed client-side, and a simple substring match is
      sufficient.
- [ ] Add support for sorting directory contents based on filename, type, and
      size.
- [ ] Include breadcrumbs that show the current location in the directory. The
      breadcrumbs should be clickable for easy navigation to parent directories.
- [ ] Implement URL navigation. The state of the app should be encoded in the
      URL. No state should be lost upon a page refresh.

While third-party dependencies are acceptable, we prefer to minimize the use of
dependencies where possible. For example:

- We prefer you use native browser APIs like
  [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) over
  third-party libraries like Axios.
- We're happy to see borrowed CSS from other projects to get a nice look and feel,
  but we do want the opportunity to evaluate how you design reusable components.
  Please implement your own components rather than using large frameworks that
  already provide components for breadcrumbs, tree-views, etc.

### Authentication

The app should also present directory information only to authenticated users.
This will require changes to both the API and the UI.

The following features are required:

- [ ] The API should reject requests from unauthenticated users
- [ ] The UI should redirect unauthenticated users to a login page. After a
      successful login, users should be directed back to the page they initially
      requested.
- [ ] The UI should provide a way for users to log out.

User sessions can be stored in memory, there is no need for a database of any
kind.

User registration / enrollment is not required. You are welcome to hard-code one
or two valid users, just let us know what their credentials are for testing
purposes.

Please do not use a third party solution that provides authentication out of
the box.

## Interview process

The interview team joins the Slack channel. The team consists of the engineers
who will be working with you. Ask them about the engineering culture, work and
life balance, or anything else that you would like to learn about Teleport.

### Design document

Before writing the actual code, create a brief design document and share with
the team. At Teleport, we prefer Markdown for
[our designs](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0000-rfds.md).

This document should include:

- the proposed UX of the app (wireframes are great)
- the proposed API
- URL structure (how will you encode the app state in the URL?)
- security, including:
  - authentication
  - TLS setup
  - protection against common web security vulnerabilities
- implementation details where appropriate (for example, session management)

A few notes about the design document:

- We expect the design document to be complete roughly within the first week.
  This is to ensure you have enough time to work on the implementation.
- Avoid writing an overly detailed design document. Two to three pages is
  sufficient.
- Avoid sending us draft design documents, it is difficult to evaluate what
  parts are draft and which parts are complete. Instead we encourage asking
  questions in Slack and sharing a design document that is ready to be
  reviewed.
- When you feel it's ready, create a PR for this document to allow the team to
  review and comment on it.

### Implementation

Split your code submission into a series of pull requests that are easy for the
team to review in a single sitting. A good “rule of thumb” is to aim to complete
the project in 3-4 PRs.

Our team will do their best to provide a high quality review of the submitted
pull requests in a reasonable time frame. You are spending your time on this, we
are going to contribute our time too.

#### First PR

Since we focus on UI skills, we ask you that the first implementation PR after
the PR with the design document includes just a bare-bones frontend-only app.
The app should display the contents of a directory based on hardcoded data, with
sorting and filtering available. In other words, a frontend-only version of the
first three features listed in [the UI section](#UI). At this point, there's no
need for URL navigation, directory traversal, breadcrumbs, or auth.

You can structure other PRs however you see fit.

### Voting

After the final submission, the interview team will assemble and vote using +1,
-2 anonymous voting system: +1 is submitted whenever a team member accepts the
submission, -2 otherwise. In case of a positive result, we will connect you to
our HR and recruiting teams, who will work out the details and present an offer.

In case of a negative score result, the hiring manager will contact you and send
a list of key observations from the team that affected the result.

## Code and project ownership

This is a test challenge and we have no intent of using the code you've
submitted in production. This is your work, and you are free to do whatever you
feel is reasonable with it. In the scenario where you don’t pass, you can open
source it with any license and use it as a portfolio project.

## Areas of focus

These are the areas we will be evaluating in the submission:

- Use consistent coding style. We use the recommended
  [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#using-eslintrecommended)
  and
  [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react#configuration)
  rules for JS, and format our code with [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- Create a few unit-tests for scenarios you think make sense.
- Make sure that dependencies are properly specified so that we get consistent results.
- Ensure error handling and error reporting is consistent. The app should report
  clear errors and not crash under non-critical conditions.
- Ensure that your app is secure.

The primary factor in the team's decision is overall code quality. We are
looking for the highest possible quality with the smallest possible scope that
meets the requirements of the challenge.

## Pitfalls and Gotchas

To help you out, we’ve composed a list of things that previously resulted in a
no-pass from the interview team:

- Scope creep. Candidates have tried to implement too much and ran out of time.
  - Avoid implementing an overly complex solution just to show that you are
    capable of writing a complex feature. Instead, if you think something could
    be made more complex in a full-fledged app, leave a comment about it and
    move on with a solution which solves the problem at hand.
  - For example, there is no need to implement a pluggable auth system which in
    the future would let you easily switch between different auth methods. It
    is better to focus on implementing a single auth method.
- Error handling. We pay extra attention to error handling. Make sure that they
  are properly handled and not ignored.
- Keep your CSS simple. We are not looking for animations, complex themes, or support
  for mobile screen size, but do want to see an app that renders correctly on various
  desktop screen sizes. Make sure that a long directory name doesn't break your layout.
- Make sure that your code is secured and your application is not vulnerable to
  common web security vulnerabilities.
  - Recommended resources:
    - [Authentication Cheat
      Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
    - [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- For a senior level, make sure you have a good crypto setup and secure session
  management.

## Scoring

We want to be as transparent as possible on how we will be scoring your
submission. You will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- The submitted code has a clear and modular structure.
- The candidate outlined the key design points in the design document.
- The code provides examples of tests covering key components.
- The code provides clear error handling and reporting.
- The app works according to the specifications, no bugs.
- The candidate demonstrates an ability to handle and apply feedback.
- The code is not vulnerable to common web security vulnerabilities.

## Questions

It is OK to ask the interview team questions. Some folks stay away from asking
questions to avoid appearing less experienced, so we provide examples of
questions to ask and questions we expect candidates to figure out on their own.

Here is a great question to ask:

> Is it OK to pre-generate secret data, like a password hash, and put it in the
> repository for a proof of concept? I will add a note that we will
> auto-generate secrets in the future.

It demonstrates that you thought about this problem domain, recognize the trade
off and are saving you and the team time by not implementing it.

This is the question we expect candidates to figure out on their own:

> What version of Go should I use? What dependency manager should I use?

Unless specified in the requirements, pick the solution that works best for you.

## Timing

You can split coding over a couple of weekdays or weekends and find time to ask
questions and receive feedback.

Once you join the Slack channel, you have 2 weeks complete the challenge.

Within this time frame, we don't give higher scores to challenges submitted more
quickly. We only evaluate the quality of the submission.

We only start the coding challenge if there are several open positions
available.
